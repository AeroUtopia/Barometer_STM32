In [changing_altitude](changing_altitude) there are files containing output from device during climbing and going down the staircase in Kapitol and B5 buildings.  
In [in_place](in_place) there are files containing output from device which was standing still in place, but the oversampling level of BMP180 sensor was changing.  
[measurements.mat](measurements.mat) is MAT-file containing above data.  
[measurement_plot.m](measurement_plot.m) is script file for MATLAB which generates [charts](charts) from above data.
