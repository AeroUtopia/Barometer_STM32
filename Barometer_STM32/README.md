# Barometer - STM32

Here are the source files along with IDE project files. Popular STM32 HAL libraries were used in project.  
I used [System Workbench for STM32](http://www.openstm32.org/System+Workbench+for+STM32) (SW4STM32) IDE together with STM32CubeMX application.  
Most of the files were generated by STM32CubeMX 4.16.0 which used STM32CubeF4 1.13.0 libraries. Configuration file for it has [.ioc](Barometer_STM32/Barometer_STM32.ioc) extension.  
STM32CubeMX allowed for easy and fast graphical configuration of microcontroller pinout, clocks and peripherals.

My code is located in:
* [bmp180.h](Barometer_STM32/Inc/bmp180.h)
* [bmp180.c](Barometer_STM32/Src/bmp180.c)
* [mpl115a1.h](Barometer_STM32/Inc/mpl115a1.h)
* [mpl115a1.c](Barometer_STM32/Src/mpl115a1.c)
* [main.c](Barometer_STM32/Src/main.c) inside tag-delimited User Code

Code for proper handling of both pressure sensors was based upon their datasheets.
